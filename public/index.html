      <p>
        Welcome to Dorpn. Our goal of the site is to make communication simple. Unlike the other
        chatting applications nowadays, you do not need to register for an account nor to keep track
        of the friends you have on this site. This site is espcially designed for situations when
        you need to work with new people for a small project, but are not close enough to add each
        other on whatever chatting application you use.
      </p>
      <strong>We're sorry but Simple Chat System doesn't work properly without JavaScript enabled. Please enable it to continue.</strong>
